# Variety infos (including min CP observed before bud break)


# Estimate b2 for each phenological stage
b2 <- tst # highest HA - lowest HA per stage & cultivar



# Initiate CP vector for cultivar
CPs <- seq(30, max(), 1)


# Estimate b1 for each phenological stage
b1 <- tst # Calculate min HR found between day of CR fulfillment and phenological stage investigated
